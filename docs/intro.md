# Intro to Litecoin

Litecoin is a digital currency, which enables instant, near-zero cost payments to anyone in the world. Built on an open source ethos. And powered by a fully decentralised global payment network. The network is secured by cryptography and empowers individuals to control their finances.

## Differences between Bitcoin and Litecoin

> “One of the goals of Litecoin is to not change what's working (from Bitcoin) unless there was a good reason to.” - [Charlie Lee](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=47417.msg564460#msg564460)


Litecoin shares a majority of its code with Bitcoin, with a large shared feature set. Notably features setting Litecoin apart from Bitcoin include:
- 2.5 min transaction confirmation time
- 84M max coins
- Scrypt proof-of-work
- MWEB privacy & fungibility
