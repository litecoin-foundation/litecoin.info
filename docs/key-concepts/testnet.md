# Testnet

The Testnet is an alternative network designed for developers to build, experiment and test new Litecoin applications. Coins on the testnet
are functionally identical, but have no monetary value. As testnet coins have no monetary value, there's no incentive for commercial miners to mine it, which means that coins can be sometimes be quickly mined. Another benefit is the lack of congestion, and fees, which allow developers to
quickly test transactions.
